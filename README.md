# Prerequisites

The provided code is in the python language. It assumes that numpy, scipy, and ASE (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) are installed 
(as well as some other standard python packages). 


# Installation

Compile the c extension with the following command

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This should result in two modules named _cGBUtils.so and _cPolyUtils.so

# Testing

A sample use of the code is provided in the file test.py Run it with the 
following command

python test.py

This should create the following files

testGB_1Periodic.cfg
testGB_1Periodic.pdb
testGB_1Periodic.lammps

testGB_2Periodic.cfg
testGB_2Periodic.pdb
testGB_2Periodic.lammps

testPoly_2Periodic.cfg
testPoly_2Periodic.pdb
testPoly_2Periodic.lammps

which contain the generated 1 periodic GB, 2 periodic GB, and the polycrystal in cfg, pdb and lammps data format, respectively. 


# Usage

Before using the provided code in python, it needs to be imported with a command like

import grainBdr as gb

To generate a GB with n11, n12 = 1, 2 and n21, n22 = 2, 1 with a "width" 100 use the following command (see the reference at the beginning of this file for definitions of n11, n12 etc)

cr = gb.onePeriodicGB(N1=[1,2],N2=[2,1],cell_width=100,verbose=False)

The returned object (cr) is of type ase.Atoms

Similary, the module to generate polycrystals can be used as 

import polyCrystal as pc

To generate a polycrystal with size 100x100 angstroms, and 4 grains (randomly oriented and positioned) use the following command 

cr = pc.periodicCrystal(L=numpy.array([100,100]),N=4)

Crystals with randomly oriented hexagonal grains, with the size of the hexagon given by 'h', and r 'repeats' can be generated by

cr = pc.periodicHexagonalCrystal(h=h,r=(r,r))
